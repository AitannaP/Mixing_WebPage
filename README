Long term:
musixmix_inTotal.ipynb and Music_Mixing_EDA.ipynb explain where I want to take this project. I have coded the formulas all in python and that is the language I am strongest in. I want to be able to do my calculations and then put them onto the webpage displaying results. the overall goal is to display what and where to mix whne mixing a song. The md file explains the concept. The ipynb explains how what i bring to this project. This shows how focused and dedicated i am to the program.
